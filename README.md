# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
In this project, we look at a number of cryptocurrencies to cluster them and try to place them in different classes. To do this, we use unsupervised machine learning, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a K-means alorithm. We find that it is best to cluster these crypto coins into 5 classes. Once this is done, we graph these cryptocurrencies based on the total amount of coin in their supply and the total amount mined.
